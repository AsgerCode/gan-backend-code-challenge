# GAN Integrity backend code challenge

The script `index.js` uses a local api to perform various operations on a set of cities. My task was to implement an api so that the script runs successfully all the way to the end.

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

After this is done, run `npm run server` to start the local web server which will be listening on port 8080.

Finally, run `npm run start` to start the script.
